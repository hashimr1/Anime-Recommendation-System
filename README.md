<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
This is an implementation of the popular arcade game [Frogger](https://froggerclassic.appspot.com/). Without access to computers with MIPS processors, the game can be tested in a MIPS simulator MARS.
The goal of the game is to get a frog from the bottom of the screen to one of the safe areas at the top.
